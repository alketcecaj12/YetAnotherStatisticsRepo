    "- ### 7.Calculating the Tolerance Interval:\n",
    "Finally, the lower and upper bounds of the tolerance interval are calculated using the mean, standard deviation, and the tolerance factor.\n",
    "By running the above code, you will get the lower and upper bounds of the tolerance interval for the given dataset. This interval tells you that with 99% confidence, 95% of the population's chemical concentration measurements fall within this range."
